What should it return?
    duplicate pairs


Should  you go over the asts 3 times? (for each duplication level once?)
    Yes

using rolling hash?
    yes

How to check if a node is a leaf node?
    children is empty

How to get a list of all attributes of Nodes, even without knowing the type?
    getAnnotations()?

how to get type of a node, or statement/declaration/expression?
    getName()

bin size?
    b = 0.1N

What is n?


type I: hash based on the name as well as properties

type II: hash based on structure, then deep compare using properties

type III: use similarityIndex and bins

remove duplicate subtrees after you have the clone classes

    Type 3: you need to be aware of the exact location of the clone, to see if all subclones occur with the same subclones

    first get all clone classes and clone pairs
    then go through all clone classe and check if a class is a subset of another class.
        for each pair you match, even if the whole class is not a subset, you can remove them from clone pairs
        (this way you only go through all clones once)


        check if node is subtree of another node by looking into src. Compare the start line and end line. There might be a fucntion in rascal for this
